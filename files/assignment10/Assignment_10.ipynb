    "Generate a 2D Gaussian mixture model data comprising of 1000 data points samples from three Gaussian distributions with the following parameters: Gaussian 1 parameters: [3, 3] and  [[0.5, 0.2], [0.2, 0.5]]; Gaussian 2 parameters = [5, 5] and [[0.6, -0.4], [-0.4, 0.6]]; and Gaussian 3 parameters: [6, 2] and [[0.4, 0.1], [0.1, 0.4]]. Mixture weights: [0.3, 0.5, 0.2]. You can use `np.random.multivariate_normal` function.\n",
    "1. **Credit 20%**: Perform expectation maximization of Gaussian mixture model assuming GMM includes 2,3,4 and 5 gaussian distributions. For each of the mixtures compute their weights. (Set init_params to k-means++ and max_iter to 1000).\n",
    "2. **Extra Credit (20%)**: If you had not know that the data included three Gaussians, how would you figure it out from the above data set. Submit a short single sentence answer.\n",
    "3. **Credit 20%**: Perform k-means clustering for k=3 (correct number).\n",
    "   - Measure its quality computing the 'silhouette'.\n",
    "   - Is the clustering: good, okay, or bad.  \n",
    "4. **Credit 20%**: Using the clustered data as labeled data (features + labels) perform a k=3 class classification (use logistic regression). What is the average accuracy of this classifier based on 10-fold cross-validation.\n",

    "- Using `make_classification` function from `sklearn.datasets` generate a dataset with 1000 samples, with each sample with 20 features, and belonging to one of 2 classes.\n",
    "- Generate training and testing data using an 80/20 split\n",
    "- Scale the training and testing data usin the `StandardScaler` function from `sklearn.preprocessing`.\n",

    "5. **Credit 10%**: Implement 5-fold cross-validation for both SVM and RF models. Calculate and return the average of their mean cross-validation scores.\n",
    "6. **Credits 10%**: Train both SVM (`kernel = 'rbf'`) and RF models on the training data. Calculate the ROC AUC score for each model on the test data. Return the average of these two scores.\n",
    "7. **Credits 10%**: Using the trained models, calculate the Precision-Recall AUC for both SVM and RF.\n",
