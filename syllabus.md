# Course summary
Computers have become essential tools for the advancement of physics. What are their limitations, and how can we use them most effectively? We will survey these topics in PHYS 177. Some potential focus areas include:
- precision and propagation of errors  
- numerical integration methods  
- Monte Carlo simulation  
- data analysis and visualization  
- machine learning and optimization  


We will use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) to introduce methods and assignments, along with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The syllabus, course web page, and assignments will all be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).


# Grading and assessment
Credit will be assigned as follows:
- homework (40%)  
- participation in labs and class discussion (20%)  
- midterm project (20%)  
- final project (20%)  


### Grading scale
Grades for each assignment and project will follow a four point scale:
- 1 -- some work, but the assignment/project is mostly incomplete  
- 2 -- the assignment/project is mostly complete, but with major errors  
- 3 -- the assignment/project is complete, with moderate errors  
- 4 -- the assignment/project is complete, with only minor errors  

More information on midterm and final projects will be available as we progress through the quarter.

I encourage you to freely collaborate with other students on homework and projects.
