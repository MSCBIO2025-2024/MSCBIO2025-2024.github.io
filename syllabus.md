# Course summary
Computers have become essential tools for biology, as well as other scientific disciplines. This course will provide students with experience using the Python programming language to solve problems and analyze biological data. We will also cover general principles of computational analysis that will help students become more productive researchers. Topic areas include:  
- Introduction to Python and command line tools  
- Data visualization  
- Numerical optimization in Python  
- Analysis of different types of biological data, including genetic sequences, protein structures, and images 

We will use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) to introduce methods and assignments, along with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The syllabus, course web page, and assignments will all be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).


# Grading and assessment
Credit will be assigned as follows:  
- homework (70%)  
- final project (30%)  

Homework assignments will be automatically graded through GitHub Classroom. You are free to resubmit your work as many times as you like before the deadline.  

<!--
### Grading scale
Grades for each assignment and project will follow a four point scale:
- 1 -- some work, but the assignment/project is mostly incomplete  
- 2 -- the assignment/project is mostly complete, but with major errors  
- 3 -- the assignment/project is complete, with moderate errors  
- 4 -- the assignment/project is complete, with only minor errors  

More information on midterm and final projects will be available as we progress through the quarter.

I encourage you to freely collaborate with other students on homework and projects.
